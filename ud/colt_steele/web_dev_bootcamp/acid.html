<h1>ACID</h1>
<p>In computer science, <b>ACID</b> (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of properties of
    database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. In the
    context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived
    as a
    single logical operation on the data) is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank
    account to
    another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single
    transaction.</p>
